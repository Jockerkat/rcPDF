# rcPDF

## About

rcPDF aims to facilitate creating PDFs as laid out in the *[ISO 32000-1:2008](https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/pdf/pdfs/PDF32000_2008.pdf)* standard.

**Disclaimer**: Development has only just started, so everything is very much incomplete and subject to change. Also, I'm new to the rust programming language, so please bear that in mind.
